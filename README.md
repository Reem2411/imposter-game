# ðŸŽ­ Imposter Game Server

An online multiplayer game where players try to identify the imposter among them. Similar to Among Us, but with a word-based twist!

## How to Play

1. **Create or Join a Session**: One player creates a session and shares the session code with others
2. **Gather Players**: Wait for at least 3 players to join (up to 10 players)
3. **Start the Game**: The host clicks "Start Game" to begin
4. **Find the Imposter**: 
   - All players except one receive a secret word
   - One player (the imposter) sees "IMPOSTER" instead of the word
   - Players discuss and try to figure out who doesn't know the word
5. **Vote**: When ready, players vote on who they think is the imposter
6. **Results**: If the imposter is caught, players win! If not, the imposter wins!
